# azure_node_fully_local
 A working example of a NodeJS based Azure Function with dockerized external dependencies.

 The idea is having an Azure Function isolated using DevContainers (VSCode extension) that is able
 to locally interact with a MSSQL service, a MongoDB service and an Azure Local Storage (Azurite) service
 being orchestrated through a docker compose definition.
